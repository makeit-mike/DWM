EDIT: I Still LOVE DWM.. but I have switched to XMonad, because I have fallen in love with Haskell

This is just my personal fork of DWM.

I did not create DWM, nor do I actively contribute to other Suckless owned repos. 

This is just so if I need to rebuild my personal DWM settings, I will have a quick way of retrieving them.
